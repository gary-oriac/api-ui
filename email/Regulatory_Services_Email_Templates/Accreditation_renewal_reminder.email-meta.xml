    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

With regards to your selective licence for the above property, our records shows your membership of your landlords association was due for renewal on  {!Contact.arcusregserv__Accreditation_Expiry_Date__c}.  

A condition of paying the discounted fee for your licence is that you maintain your accredited membership and provide proof of this annually.  Please, therefore  provide a copy of your membership renewal  within the next 7 days.
