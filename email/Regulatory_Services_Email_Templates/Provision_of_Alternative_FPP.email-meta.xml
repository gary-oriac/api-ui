    <subject>Selective Licence: Provision of Alternative Fit and Proper Person</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!arcusregserv__RS_Activity__c.arcusregserv__Contact__r.Salutation} {!arcusregserv__RS_Activity__c.arcusregserv__Contact__r.FirstName} {!arcusregserv__RS_Activity__c.arcusregserv__Contact__r.LastName},

Further to your application for selective licensing of {!arcusregserv__RS_Activity__c.arcusregserv__Licence_Record_Type__c} application.

Your application cannot be progressed any further as [enter full name of fit and proper person] has not passed the ‘Fit and Proper’ requirement to enable them to be the [licenceholder/manager] of this property.

You must therefore find an alternative licenceholder/manager who cannot be connected to [enter full name of fit and proper person] by family or business connections.  You application has been re-opened for you to provide details of the replacement licence holder/manager. Please visit your ‘MyAccount’ within the next 7 days to provide the relevant details and documentation.

You have the right of appeal against this decision to the First Tier Tribunal

If you wish to discuss the matter further or would like advice on this matter please contact the case officer.

Yours Sincerely,
