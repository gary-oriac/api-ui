    <subject>Temporary Exemption Notice Location application ref: {!arcusregserv__RS_Licence__c.Name}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Regarding the temporary exemption notice for the above property. I confirm that the current exemption expires on {!arcusregserv__RS_Licence__c.arcusregserv__End_Date_Granted__c}.

Upon expiry of the current exemption period you must either:

 - Provide written confirmation detailing why your property no longer requires a licence
 - Apply for a further temporary exemption notice
 - Apply for a selective licence.

An application for a further temporary exemption notice can only be granted once, giving 6 months exemption in total, and only in certain circumstances so please speak to the case officer for advice before applying as refunds cannot be given.

Please submit your selective licence or temporary exemption application via MyAccount.Peterborough.gov.uk.

If you have any queries regarding this notice please contact the case officer.

Yours sincerely
Housing Enforcement Team
